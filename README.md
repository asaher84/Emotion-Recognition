# Emotion-Recognition

#This project aims to develop an emotion recognition system that accurately identifies human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning techniques.


#Features
* Deep Learning Model: Implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize emotions from facial images.
* Dataset: Utilized the FER-2013 dataset, containing 35,000+ labeled images of facial expressions across seven emotion categories.
* Preprocessing: Performed image preprocessing including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance model robustness.
* Model Training: Trained the CNN model using Keras and TensorFlow, achieving high accuracy in emotion classification.
* Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Visualization: Provided visualizations of training progress and emotion prediction results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* Deployment: Deployed the trained model using Flask to create a web application for real-time emotion recognition from webcam input.
